{"course code":"ECLR52","course title":"Transmission Lines and Antenna Lab","number of credits":"1","prerequisites":"ECPC31, ECPC51","course type":"ELR","branch":"ec","course learning objectives":"- The students should be able to validate the theoretical principles of Transmission Lines and Antennas through hands on experience.n- Determine the primary (R, L, G, C) and secondary (γ, α, β , Zo) constants, reflection coefficient, SWR, Q of resonant line sections on dedicated Transmission Line design kits. Also, analyze impedance matching through Quarter-wave transformer and Stub Lines.n- Design, measure, quantify and plot the fields radiated by various forms of antenna structures and analyze their performance.n- Compare simulated results obtained by software and theoretical results."}
