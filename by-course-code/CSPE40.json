{"course code":"CSPE40","course title":"High Performance Computing","number of credits":"4","prerequisites":"CSPE315","course type":"PE","branch":"cs","course learning objectives":"The objective of course, is to provide a comprehensive introduction to parallel algorithms and parallel programming, with strong emphasis on the design of parallel algorithms and their rigorous analysis. Exposure to parallel programming is provided through programming assignments using MPI. Throughout the course, the design of algorithms is interlaced with the programming techniques useful in coding them.","course content":"- Performance measures: Speedup, efficiency and scalability.
