Task-centred system design: Task-centered process, development of task examples, evaluation of designs through a task-centered walk-through. User-centred design and prototyping: Assumptions, participatory design, methods for involving the user, prototyping, low fidelity prototypes, medium fidelitynMethods for evaluation of interfaces with users and Psychology of everyday things:nGoals of evaluation, approaches, ethics, introspection, extracting the conceptual model, direct observation, constructive interaction, interviews and questionnaires, continuous evaluation via user feedback and field studies, choosing an evaluation method. Psychology of everyday things: Psychopathology of everyday things, examples, concepts for designing everyday things. Beyond screen design: characteristics of good representations, information visualization, Tufteâ€™s guidelines, visual variables, metaphors, direct manipulationnGraphical screen design, Design principles and usability heuristics:nGraphical design concepts, components of visible language, graphical design by grids. Design principles and usability heuristics: Design principles, principles to support usability, golden rules and heuristics, HCI patternsnHCI design standards, Past and future of HCI:nProcess-oriented standards, product-oriented standards, strengths and limitations of HCI Standards. Past and future of HCI: The past, present and future, perceptual interfaces, context-awareness and perception","reference books":"- Dix A., Finlay J., Abowd G.
