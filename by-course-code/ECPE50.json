Also, understand the various techniques for representation of the data in the real world with the concepts of protection and management of data.","course content":"## UNIT InnINTRODUCTION: Understanding pointers, usage of pointers, arithmetic on pointers, memory allocation, memory management functions and operators, debugging pointers dangling pointers, memory leaks, etc. The Concept of data type, definition and brief description of various data structures, data structures versus data types, operations on data structures, algorithm complexity, Big O notation.nnn## UNIT IInnLINKED LIST, STACKS AND QUEUES: Linear and multi-dimensional arrays and their representation, operations on arrays, sparse matrices and their storage. Linear linked list, operations on linear linked list, doubly linked list, operations on doubly linked list, application of linked lists. Sequential and linked representations, operations on stacks, application of stacks such as parenthesis checker, evaluation of postfix expressions, conversion from infix to postfix representation, implementing recursive functions. Sequential representation of queue, linear queue, circular queue, operations on linear and circular queue, linked representation of a queue and operations on it, deque, priority queue, applications of queues.nnn## UNIT IIInnTREE AND HEAP: Basic terminology, sequential and linked representations of trees, traversing a binary tree using recursive and non-recursive procedures, inserting a node, deleting a node, briefnintroduction to threaded binary trees, AVL trees and B-trees. Representing a heap in memory, operations on heaps, application of heap in implementing priority queue and heap sort algorithm.nnn## UNIT IVnnGRAPHS, SORTING AND SEARCHING: Basic terminology of Graphs, representation of graphs (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal of a graph (breadth-first search and depth-first search), and applications of graphs. Comparing direct address tables with hash tables, hash functions, concept of collision and its resolution using open addressing and separate chaining, double hashing, rehashing.
